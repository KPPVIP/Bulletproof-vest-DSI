Hi there random stranger on the internet

First thanks for downloading

How to install for fiveM (EUP):

First you need to have the original model that is in this pack: https://www.gta5-mods.com/player/eup-vest-pack

Here you can find the model: EUP VEST PACK 1.0\FILE\male vests\vest1\setup5\mp_m_freemode_01_mp_m_vinewood

once you found the model you only need to replace the .ytd file.

and add this to your eup-stream folder

and enjoy
